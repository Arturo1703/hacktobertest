# hacktobertest
Exercise for hacktoberfest 2019 event at Facultad de Informatica Universidad Complutense de Madrid

The idea is to create a series of 5 exercises (due to the 5 pull requests that are nedeed to qualify to the hacktoberfest program, if this number changed we could easily adapt) that are individual so that we can make up several teams of 2-5 people and each of them solves every one of the 5 exercises.

### Okay, but how are we doing it?

1. To begin with, we have to select the language that we are going to be using
    * We suggested javascript as it doesnt necessarily need a compiler or advanced knowledge.
2. Are we using some sort of easy to use library such as p5.js to do some drawings or some AI library?

3. In our effort to make the exercise interesting , we will make it as a puzzle where there are missing pieces of code that need to be discovered and produced by the users. Dont worry, we 'll keep it simple.

### And what are 5 pull request going to teach anyone?

1. In order for us to accept the pull request, it will need to pass a certain criteria based on simple and logical community programming features, such as some description, minimum documentation and clear code.]

2. After the activity, if distributed between groups, not all of the people in them will have completed the goal of 5 p.r. to win the shirt so if they want it, they will have to go home and search for a project, start one of their own or throw requests to this one. 
    * not only will have they earned a t-shirt but also they will have basic git knowledge and an introduction to the open source, community driven world of applications. 
    
### We hope you find it useful , elseways throw a p.r. or open an issue xD
