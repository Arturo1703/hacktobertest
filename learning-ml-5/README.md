### ml5 exercise

#### What is the goal of this exercise?

* We want you to learn somethings about ml5 and a different way of experimenting machine learning, a fun one, so we are providing you with the boring stuff..the handler functions...that you dont need to worry about , so you can focus on putting together the missing pieces of the code to make the models work

* Please keep in mind that there will be 5 exercises here, you may do distribute them as you like most, but we recommend one pull per exercise.

1. Keep in mind that a pre-trained model doesnt have full accuracy but for reasons of complexity is what we are using in these examples. Instead, it has a finite number of elements it knows about. These models come from online so you will need internet access.

2. But , we encourage you to learn and do research about the models and whats behind them.

3. Please keep in mind that: The examples provided here use models that may take some seconds or longer depending on your computer , for them to load. And also, as mentioned earlier, these models come from the internet so that may also be a cause for it to go slowly.
