             Lets learn a bit about machine learning using a very high-level library , called ml5 by Danniel Siffman.

             <br><br>

             In these brief tutorial we will be doing some examples on these library which is on top of tensorflow.js

             <br><br>

             This library uses p5.js and pre-trained models to abstract from the mathematics of machine learning. If you want to feel the pain of learning the math, ask me for resources.

            <h3>Exercise #1</h3>
            <h4>The simple pre-trained classifier</h4>
            When you feel ready to do the first exercise go to:

            <br><br>

            Make sure you read the readme file!!

            <a href="https://github.com/dlgeraghty/hacktobertest/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/dlgeraghty/hacktobertest/blob/master/README.md</a>

            <br><br>

            For this exercise you will need to have a look at:<br>
            <a href="https://ml5js.github.io/ml5-library/docs/#/reference/image-classifier">https://ml5js.github.io/ml5-library/docs/#/reference/image-classifier</a>

            <br><br>

            Good luck to you all!

           <h3>Exercise #2</h3>
           <h4>The webcam pre-trained classifier</h4>
           Okey, now yo are all warmed up

           <br><br>

           Next we are going to be doing an exercise , based on the first one, but instead of recognising static images, we are going to feed it with what our webcam is seeing

           <br><br>

          The code you are given as a starting point (it is a slightly modified version from the first exercise) , can be found in:<a href="https://github.com/dlgeraghty/hacktobertest/tree/master/learning-ml-5/webcam-image-classification">https://github.com/dlgeraghty/hacktobertest/tree/master/learning-ml-5/webcam-image-classification</a>

           <br><br>

           What do you need to change from the first exercise specifically:

            <ul class="collection blue-grey-text">
              <li class="collection-item">Instead of the createImg function (remember this one is from p5.js library) we now need a function that gets the video from the webcam, but dont worry, this is already implemented in p5.js, find it!</li>
              <li class="collection-item">We dont need to use the image ready function now...</li>
              <li class="collection-item">How can we achieve continuous predictions?</li>
              <li class="collection-item">Note: dont use console.log for the results of this examples, instead, a helper funciton to draw text is given in the code</li>
            </ul>

           Good luck to you all!

          <h3>Exercise #3</h3>
          <h4>The harder custom made classifier</h4>
          You may have noticed the difference of complexity from the first exercise to the second one. Now we are moving on to the more heavy duty exercises.

          <br><br>

          We are going to be teaching the pre-trained model to learn about our own images!. This technique is called transfer model. Its like re-training an existing model without giving the model the labels.

          <br><br>

         The code you are given as a starting point (it is a slightly modified version from the first exercise) , can be found in:<a href="https://github.com/dlgeraghty/hacktobertest/tree/master/learning-ml-5/webcam-image-classification">https://github.com/dlgeraghty/hacktobertest/tree/master/learning-ml-5/webcam-image-classification</a>
         The given code is a simplified version of what you have to do.
          <br><br>

          The goal of this exercise is to re-train the model in order to distinguish between a happy and a sad face!

          <br><br>

          Here is where things start to get developmentwise more serious, if you accept the challenge, all I can give you is the documentation page:
          <a href="https://ml5js.org/reference/api-FeatureExtractor/">https://ml5js.org/reference/api-FeatureExtractor/</a>

          <br><br>
          More detail in the code you are give, there is a pseudocode there you can use

           <h3>Exercise #4</h3>
           <h4>The study-code-sleep-repeat project</h4>
           This is an exercise that is to be done by the public who wants to get involved in a mini community
           <br><br>

           The idea, is to build a face-recognition service that works as a lock, with the knowledge you have learned in these exercises.
           <br><br>
           Some thing you may want to take into consideration are:
           <ul class="collection blue-grey-text">
             <li class="collection-item">How do I get sufficient variety in the samples?</li>
             <li class="collection-item">Do I have to re-train the model each time I want to use it?</li>
             <li class="collection-item">What is the level of accuracy that I can get?</li>
             <li class="collection-item">May I consider learning a lower-level technology such as tensorflow to improve performace?</li>
           </ul>

           All the people who worked on this talk and the community in general would be very happy and welcoming for a project like this. If some of you happen to want to start it, please let us know!
